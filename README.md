# Adivinhe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dygufa/adivinhe_site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dygufa/adivinhe_site)

Adivinhe is a guessing game made on 2011 during my high school days that I have the intention to rewrite in the next months using a more modern stack. It has been deactivated for years and **has a few (or a lot, idk) glitches**.

# TODO

[ ] Rewrite it using React  
[ ] Use websocket or start to use a REST api with long-pooling  
[ ] Write tests
